# python
Just my repo for learning.

# setup
* Copy config file docs folder to location.
* Ammend config and start service.

# usage
python3 worstPythonWebserverEver -c /path/to/config/file.config

# Other notes
This webserver is under an intial release 1.0 and although is functional
It lacks some of the features described in the config. This is not a 
production ready application, and should only be used by the brave.
